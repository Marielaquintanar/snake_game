# Snake Game

## Project Description

The Snake Game is a classic and addictive video game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow in length. The objective 
is to avoid running into walls or colliding with the snake's own tail while trying to achieve the highest score possible. As the snake consumes more food, it becomes 
longer, making the game progressively challenging.
This project has been implemented using Python and the Pygame library, which provides the necessary tools to create a visually appealing and interactive Snake Game.

### Key Features

- Control the snake's movement using arrow keys.
- Random placement of food items on the screen.
- Score tracking to monitor the player's progress.
- Game over when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer.
